    Technology: You can only give the funds to people that have access to a smartphone.`,

    - Max of 5 donations to your family 
    - Max of 5 donations to your friends 
    - All other donations should be given to people that are within your community and that do not have personal connections to you. These could be people you know through church, people you see on the street, friends-of-friends, etc.`,

  },
  {
    question: "What would fraud look like?",
    answer:
      "It could appear in different forms. For example, it might look like one person repeatedly asking to be a recipient. They might tell you different names but they are actually the same person. You will want to be on the look-out for that type of bad behaviour.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What should I talk about with the recipients when I meet with them?",
    answer:
      "GiveCrypto’s Field Operations team member will tell you what you need to discuss with the recipients. In short, you will provide them =with an overview of the project and how cryptocurrency works. The information in these FAQs plus the information provided by the Field Operations team member will be everything that you need to discuss.",

We are excited to have you contributing to that mission!",
