  {
    question: `How will the funds help people?`,
    answer: `There is substantial [evidence](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers) that unconditional cash transfers are an effective way to help people. Distributing crypto is similar to transferring other forms of money to people. We expect many recipients will find ways to convert the crypto into their local currency. Some may transact crypto-to-crypto as well. It may also help spark economic growth by giving access to property rights and financial services on an open network. A great deal of work needs to be done to test these hypotheses and see what it most effective.`,

  {
    question: "Why is crypto better than fiat?",
    answer: `While cryptocurrency is somewhat difficult to use (for now) and isn’t accepted by many vendors (yet), it does have some benefits compared to fiat currencies.
