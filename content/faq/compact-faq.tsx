    question: `How will my donation be used?`,
    answer: `Funds will be used to distribute payments to recipients, distribution partners, and cover operational overhead. In the future we plan to move to a model where 100% of donated funds go to our recipients and distribution partners. At that time, GiveCryptoâ€™s operating overhead will be covered by the board and initial fundraise.`

  {
    question: `How do the funds get distributed to people in need?`,
    answer: `We will be testing out a number of distribution strategies over time. To get started, we're traveling to regions ourselves to distribute funds in person. We're also speaking with a handful of nonprofits who could act as distribution partners (organizations with local people operating in markets that we are interested in reaching). Finally, we may build an a decentralized application in the future to create a trust network for distributions. Recipients can save or spend their crypto, or convert it into cash using local exchanges.`

  {
    question: `How will the funds help people?`,
    answer: `There is substantial [evidence](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers) that unconditional cash transfers are an effective way to help people. Distributing crypto is similar to transferring other forms of money to people. We expect many recipients will find ways to convert the crypto into their local currency. Some may transact crypto-to-crypto as well. It may also help spark economic growth by giving access to property rights and financial services on an open network. A great deal of work needs to be done to test these hypotheses and see what it most effective.`
