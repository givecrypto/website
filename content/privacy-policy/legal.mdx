**<a name="blockchain-networks" />BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS AND THIRD PARTY EXCHANGE PLATFORMS**

The Services grant users the option to broadcast transactions on various distributed ledger networks powered by open-source protocols (“**Blockchain Networks**”). For example, the Services allow you to send Bitcoin to GiveCrypto via the Bitcoin Blockchain Network. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information transmitted to a Blockchain Network through the Services. 

Transaction information broadcast to a Blockchain Network includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount of digital currency sent, and any other data you may choose to include. Due to the inherent nature of Blockchain Networks, information stored on a Blockchain Network is public and cannot be removed or deleted. You should be aware that any information posted to a Blockchain Network will be made permanently available to the public. Your transactions and addresses may reveal information about you and those with whom you are transacting. Such information can potentially be correlated with you and others now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. 

We may integrate the Services with third party cryptocurrency exchanges (“**Exchanges**”) where we operate accounts. If you choose to donate cryptocurrency from such an Exchange to the Services, you may have the option to transfer the funds in a manner that is not broadcast on Blockchain Networks (i.e. "off-chain"). In such scenarios, your transaction information will be shared with the Exchange and processed in accordance with the Exchange’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

**<a name="collection-of-information" />COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

**Information You Provide to Us**

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, you share information directly with us when you fill out a form on our Site, submit a donation, communicate with us via third-party platforms, participate in a contest or promotion, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of personal information we may collect include your name, email address, country of residence, postal address, photo ID, payment information, and any other information you choose to provide.

**Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with Us**

When you access or use our Services or otherwise transact with us, we automatically collect certain information, including:



*   **Transactional Information:** When you make a donation or, if you are an eligible recipient, receive a donation, we collect information about the transaction, such as the amount and type of cryptocurrency transmitted or received, and the date and time of the transaction.
*   **Device and Usage Information:** We collect information about how you access our Services, including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app version. We also collect information about your activity on our Services, such as access times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
*   **Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:** We (and our service providers) use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are electronic images that we use on our Services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see the [Your Choices](#your-choices) section below.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**

We obtain information from third-party sources. For example, we may collect information about you from Exchanges or other payment processors we receive transactions from, identity verification services, credit bureaus, advertising networks, data analytics providers, and mailing list providers. If you make or accept a donation through your account at an Exchange we integrate with (such as Coinbase, Inc.), we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your first and last name, certain transaction information, and if you opt-in, your email address, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.

**Information We Derive**

We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about the risk of transacting with you based upon the information that you provide to us.

**<a name="use-of-information" />USE OF INFORMATION**

**<a name="advertising" />ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS **

We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile apps. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages, and links clicked. This information may be used by GiveCrypto_ _and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.

While we do not do this today, in the future we may work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of customized campaigns on third-party platforms (such as Facebook and Instagram). As part of these ad campaigns, we or the third-party platforms may convert information about you, such as your interests in certain regional causes (e.g., your interest in regional causes in East Africa), into a unique value that can be matched with a user account on these platforms to allow us to learn about your interests and serve you advertising that is customized to your interests. Note that the third-party platforms may offer you choices about whether you see these types of customized ads.

**<a name="transfer-of-information" />TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES**

GiveCrypto is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations and service providers in the United States. Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
